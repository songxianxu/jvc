# JVC - Julia version control (experimental)

**This is a project still in experimental stage. Many syntax and notations are not standardized yet. Use with care.**
**There are many things to be fixed as I am not good in writing shell script. Comments are welcome.**

`jvc` is inspired from `jill.sh`, `jill.py`, and `nvm-sh`. Besides basic installation features, I would also like a more flexible installation and also version management of Julia.

**Why?** Julia is a fast evolving language. It might be good to provide a way for developers to test their codes locally for various versions. Or perhaps users are eagear to try new versions, e.g., rc or beta. 

**What the script will do?** In .jvcrc, various environment variables can be found 
- `jvc` will download all the jua binaries`JULIA_DOWNLOAD_DIR`, which is set as `$HOME/Downloads/julia/` by default
    - `jvc download`
    - `jvc install`
- `jvc` will extract the binaries to `$JULIA_INSTALL_DIR`, which is set as `$HOME/apps/julia/` by defaut. 
    - `jvc install`
    - `jvc remove`
- `jvc` will manipulate symbolic links in `$JULIA_SYMLINK_DIR`, which is set as `$HOME/.local/bin` by defaut. Relevant operations are: 
    - `jvc load`
    - `jvc unload`
    - `jvc switch`
    - `jvc install`
- `jvc` tracks `$UPSTREAM_NAME` in `.jvcrc` file and uses `upstream.conf` for possible upstream settings. 
   - `jvc upstream`
- `jvc` might manipuate your `(.julia)` folder in `$JULIA_DEPOT_PATH` only for migrating `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` files between major minor versions. Relevant operations are:
   - `jvc migrate`


## Installation

1. Clone this repo in your prefered place such as `~/.jvc`   
2. Make it visible by appending `export PATH=$PATH:~/.jvc:~/.local/bin/jvc/` to your shell rc file such as `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`

Note that `~/.local/bin/jvc/` is the default `$JULIA_SYMLINK_DIR` set in `~.jvcrc`. You can change as you like. Also you may or may not need to make it executable, `chmod +x ~/.jvc/jvc`


Various environment variables in `.jvcrc` can be tuned to suit your preferences.

- `JULIA_DOWNLOAD_DIR=$HOME/Downloads/Julia/` Download folder for julia installation tarball 
- `JULIA_INSTALL_DIR=$HOME/apps/julia/` Installation folder for julia
- `JULIA_SYMLINK_DIR=$HOME/.local/bin/jvc/` Symbolic link folder for julia

`.jvcrc` records some environment variables, it may not be so necessary but I do not want to "help" modifying your shell rc files.


## Basic usage

### Install/Installed
```shell
jvc install # Install the newest stable version from 
jvc install 1 # Install the newest major version 1
jvc install 1.5 # Install the newest major minor version 1.5
jvc install 1.5.3 # Install 1.5.3
jvc install 1.6.0 # Install 1.6.0, if not stable version exist, show rc version.
jvc install 1.6.0-rc1
jvc install rc
jvc install lts 
jvc install nightly
jvc installed # list all installed version 
```

### Download
Download follows the same logic as install 

### Loaded/Load/Unload/Switch/Purge
```
jvc loaded # list all loaded symbolic link
jvc load 1.4.2 # make julia-1.4.2 available
jvc unload 1.4.2 # make julia-1.4.2 unavailable
jvc switch # switch the alias julia to a specific version
jvc purge # remove all symblic link except julia
```
### Status 
```
jvc status # List all relevant information such as installed, loaded, upstream, downloaded
```
### Avail
```
jvc available # list all possible version from remote
jvc avail 
jvc avail all # this will include rc and beta version.
```

### Search 
```
jvc search 1
jvc search 1.1
jvc search 1.2
```

### Migrate 
```
jvc migrate 1.5 to 1.6
```
This will copy the `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` from one version to another version. This is also known as version "upgrade" in `jill.sh` or `jill.py`.

### nightly 
```
jvc nightly # Install the nightly version 
```
Note that there is no shasum check yet for nightly yet. Perhaps I didn't manage to find it.

### upstream
```
jvc upstream # Select your upstream, default: Official
```

### Update (Not implemented yet)
Update jvc itself?
```
jvc update
```
